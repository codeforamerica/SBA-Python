Python Wrapper for SBA APIs (www.sba.gov/api/), follows 
https://github.com/codeforamerica/SBA-PHP-Library (a thin wrapper).

For examples, see documentation for each method in api.py.

21 Jun 2011: All methods finished. Todo: Rewrite to be more 
pythonic/follow the syntax of other python wrappers more closely. Also, write 
class documentation, split each API class into its own file (similar to 
https://github.com/codeforamerica/sba_ruby).
